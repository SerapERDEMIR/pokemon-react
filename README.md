# pokemon-react

* This project is an interactive React application that simulates an exciting Pokemon card game. The main component, called Pokegame, forms the heart of the game. This component allows for an intense battle by distributing randomly selected Pokemon cards between two players.

* The Pokemon cards in each player's hand vary each time the game starts, as the cards are randomly chosen. This ensures that each game is unique and unpredictable. Players compete against each other using the experience points of their Pokemon cards.

* The Pokegame component calculates the total experience points of both players by comparing their Pokemon cards. The outcome of this comparison determines whether a player has emerged victorious.

* The Pokedex component displays the Pokemon cards in the hands of both players, along with the total experience points of these cards. This allows users to delve into the details of the game and discover how to guide their strategic decisions.

* Every time the page is refreshed, players and Pokemon cards are reshuffled, creating a new wave of excitement. This ensures that users experience a different game each time and enhances the replayability of the game.

* This React application injects an exciting touch into the Pokemon world, providing users with an entertaining game platform designed to both entertain and enhance their strategic thinking skills.
